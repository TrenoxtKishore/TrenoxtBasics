Light Blink Sequence Using 555 Timer and Arduino UNO
- This consists of code files which is used for my Arduino project
- 555 timer has been used to generate a square wave output
- On experimenting our project in real-time situation we have not obtained a square-wave output
- This could be rectified with the help of a capacitor connected in parallel to the output, to smoothen the waveform.
